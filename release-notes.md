## What's New in v0.1.3

- **Idle freeze fixed**: libretro cores (Gambatte, FCEUmm, gpSP, etc.) could freeze when left running without input. Audio output is now handled on a dedicated thread so the emulator never blocks on the sound device — the hang is gone.
- **Nearest filter warning**: selecting the **Nearest** scaling filter now shows a notice that it is software-scaled and slower than **Bilinear** (hardware path), which can cause lag on heavier cores.

## High-Level Overview

TreeFrogUI is a heavily modified fork of FrogUI, ported to run within the `picoarch` environment on the MIPS-based SF3000 handheld. It provides a clean, minimalistic emulation frontend while supporting a massive range of retro gaming platforms.

### Key Features Included:

- **Minimalist & Fast Interface**: A distraction-free ROM browser with vertical system list navigation and intuitive controls.
- **57 Emulator Cores**: Upgraded from only 14 stock cores, adding compatibility for systems like **PICO-8** (via Fake08/Retro8 — supports both `.p8` and `.p8.png` carts), **Quake** (via Tyrquake), **Cave Story** (via NXEngine), **Doom** (via PrBoom), and classic computers like Commodore Amiga and Atari ST.
- **Highly Configurable Cores**: Full support for tweaking libretro core options directly, enabling retro features like system color palette swaps, LCD ghosting emulation, and key mappings.
- **Proper PCSX4ALL Integration**: A configurable PlayStation 1 emulator core supporting `.iso`, `.bin`/`.cue`, `.pbp`, and other standard disc formats.
- **In-Game Save Support**: Battery saves and in-game saves are fully supported across all compatible cores.
- **Auto-Resume on Boot**: Automatically launches you back into your last-played game or the system frontend menu when you boot up your device.
- **Rich Theming Options**: Includes 30 built-in color themes (selectable in-app) and support for custom fonts and per-system/per-folder background images (`PNG`, `JPG`, `BMP`).
- **Flexible Aspect Ratio Scaling**: Switch between Zoom, Aspect Ratio, and Integer Scaling display modes on the fly.
- **Useful In-Game Shortcuts**: Use **`SELECT + START`** to open the in-game picoarch menu (all cores except PCSX4ALL), **`SELECT + L`** to open the emulator menu (PCSX4ALL only) or load a state (slot 0, default), and **`SELECT + R`** to save a state (slot 0, default).
- **Custom Boot Logo**: Includes a custom-fit, top-down `xgame-logo.bmp` splash screen to replace the stock boot logo on your device.

## Troubleshooting & Feedback

- **Black Screen / Only Battery Icon Visible:** If nothing loads or only the battery icon is visible after the boot logo, set up your SD card with the clean **[Stock OS Backup](https://github.com/Q-ta-s/q-ta-s.github.io/releases/download/sf3000/SF3000_sdcard.7z)** first, then copy the TreeFrogUI files over.
