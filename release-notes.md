# TreeFrogUI v0.1.4 - Release Notes

Welcome to **TreeFrogUI** (v0.1.4) for the SF3000 and R36SX handheld consoles!

> [!WARNING]
> This release supports the initial **SF3000** hardware iterations and the **R36SX** (firmware **v2.6** and **v2.7**). One build runs on both — the device is auto-detected at boot.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is an **early release** of the project and should be considered a beta/preview version. Since I was the only person testing it during development, it is highly likely that you will encounter bugs, quirks, or compatibility issues. 
> 
> Please help improve the project by leaving your feedback, bug reports, and suggestions here:

## What's New in v0.1.4

- **R36SX support (v2.6 / v2.7)**: a single build now runs on both the SF3000 and the R36SX. The device is auto-detected at boot (panel resolution, the correct `driver.so`, and the render path are all selected automatically). FrogUI renders natively at each panel's resolution (SF3000 854×480, R36SX 640×480).
- **gpSP (GBA) fixed**: the MIPS dynarec now works — GBA games run at full speed (previously crashed on launch). Demanding SuperFX titles like Yoshi's Island run but remain heavy.
- **Arduboy added**: the `arduous` core now builds and runs. Use `.hex` roms (`.arduboy` ZIP files are not supported — extract the `.hex` first).
- **ZX Spectrum (fuse) controls fixed**: the gamepad now drives the **Kempston** joystick by default (was the Cursor joystick, which most games don't use).

## What's New in v0.1.3

- **Idle freeze fixed**: libretro cores (Gambatte, FCEUmm, gpSP, etc.) could freeze when left running without input. Audio output is now handled on a dedicated thread so the emulator never blocks on the sound device — the hang is gone.
- **Nearest filter warning**: selecting the **Nearest** scaling filter now shows a notice that it is software-scaled and slower than **Bilinear** (hardware path), which can cause lag on heavier cores.

## High-Level Overview

TreeFrogUI is a heavily modified fork of FrogUI, ported to run within the `picoarch` environment on the MIPS-based SF3000 handheld. It provides a clean, minimalistic emulation frontend while supporting a massive range of retro gaming platforms.

### Key Features Included:

- **Minimalist & Fast Interface**: A distraction-free ROM browser with vertical system list navigation and intuitive controls.
- **57 Emulator Cores**: Upgraded from only 14 stock cores, adding compatibility for systems like **PICO-8** (via Fake08/Retro8 — supports both `.p8` and `.p8.png` carts), **Quake** (via Tyrquake), **Cave Story** (via NXEngine), **Doom** (via PrBoom), and classic computers like Commodore Amiga and Atari ST.
- **Highly Configurable Cores**: Full support for tweaking libretro core options directly, enabling retro features like system color palette swaps, LCD ghosting emulation, and key mappings.
- **Proper PCSX4ALL Integration**: A configurable PlayStation 1 emulator core supporting `.iso`, `.bin`/`.cue`, `.pbp`, and other standard disc formats.
- **In-Game Save Support**: Battery saves and in-game saves are fully supported across all compatible cores.
- **Auto-Resume on Boot**: Automatically launches you back into your last-played game or the system frontend menu when you boot up your device.
- **Rich Theming Options**: Includes 30 built-in color themes (selectable in-app) and support for custom fonts and per-system/per-folder background images (`PNG`, `JPG`, `BMP`).
- **Flexible Aspect Ratio Scaling**: Switch between Zoom, Aspect Ratio, and Integer Scaling display modes on the fly.
- **Useful In-Game Shortcuts**: Use **`SELECT + START`** to open the in-game picoarch menu (all cores except PCSX4ALL), **`SELECT + L`** to open the emulator menu (PCSX4ALL only) or load a state (slot 0, default), **`SELECT + R`** to save a state (slot 0, default), **`SELECT + Y`** to cycle fast-forward (off → 2× → 3× → off, audio mutes), and hold **`SELECT + B`** to rewind.
- **Custom Boot Logo**: Includes a custom-fit, top-down `xgame-logo.bmp` splash screen to replace the stock boot logo on your device.

## Troubleshooting & Feedback
